\noindent 
During our Spring 2025 faculty retreat, I was assigned the task of drafting a \emph{B}ring \emph{Y}our \emph{O}wn \emph{D}evice (BYOD) policy for CS students. This draft policy outlines the system requirements. The earliest we can implement the policy is beginning in the academic year 2026-27, i.e, with the class of 2031.

The proposed policy is based on similar BYOD policy that I drafted in 2001 for the University of Chicago's Master of Computer Science program, as well as on current BYOD policies from \href{https://clemsonpub.cfmnetwork.com/B.aspx?BookId=11654&PageId=458060}{Clemson University}, \href{https://www.fit.edu/policies/information-technology/policies/it-1015-bring-your-own-device-byod-policy/}{Florida Institute of Technology}, and Northern Illinois University.
